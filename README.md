# Discord.js Bot

Since discord.py is no longer receiving support, it's days are numbered. Discord.js 
seems like the better option in the long term. 

# Version 0.1

Discord bot logs in and prints success message. Run the bot with `node index.js` from the app directory.

## The Task

- [x] Convert our custom discord.py functions to discord.js functions
- [ ] Containerize js bot
- [ ] Host js bot on home server
